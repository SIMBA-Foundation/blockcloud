    <h2>4. Compiling and running the prototype on a standard Linux distribution</h2>
    The prototype for a standard Linux distribution consists of several pieces:
    <ul>
        <li>A modified Linux kernel.  The modifications are small, but are
        necessary to load the kernel module.</li>
        <li>A kernel module that implements the new address family,
        AF_NAME.</li>
        <li>A userspace daemon.  This handles tasks like DNS queries on behalf
        of the kernel module.</li>
        <li>A test client and server.</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="kernel">
    <h2>4.1. Modifying and running the kernel</h2>
    </a>
    The prototype introduces a new protocol family, PF_NAME, to the kernel.
    The kernel has a fixed-size array of protocol families, so it's necessary
    to extend this array and recompile the kernel in order to add the new
    protocol family.  Unfortunately the size of the array changes from time
    to time, so you'll need to apply a patch appropriate to your kernel version.
    Change to the top-level directory of your kernel source.  Assuming the
    patches for the prototype are in ~/patches, apply the version-specific
    patches first.  For example, assuming you're running kernel version
    2.6.29:
<pre>
$ git am ~/patches/kernel/2.6.29/*
</pre>
    I have versions for 2.6.25, 2.6.27, and 2.6.29.  2.6.28 also works, with
    the 2.6.29 patch.  I haven't tried 2.6.26 or kernel versions newer than
    2.6.29.
    <p>
    Next apply the common kernel changes:
<pre>
$ git am ~/patches/kernel/common/*
</pre>
    The main change these make increases the size of struct sockaddr_storage
    to accomodate the DNS name that the name-oriented stack uses as a socket
    address.
    <p>
    The remaining changes don't absolutely have to be in the kernel
    headers, but they're more conveniently located in them since they're used
    both by the kernel portion of the name oriented stack, and its user-space
    daemon.
    <p>
    In section <a href="../linux.html">3. Compiling and running the Linux
    kernel within a virtual machine</a>, you already learned how to configure,
    compile, and run your own kernel.  Now that you've modified the kernel to
    be able to support the name-oriented stack, you'll want to recompile it,
    install it, and run it.
    <a name="module">
    <h2>4.2. Building and running the kernel module</h2>
    </a>
    The kernel module source is also a series of patches.  You can apply them
    in the way suggested in <a href="../git.html">section 2. Working with
    git</a>:
    <pre>
$ mkdir namestack
$ cd namestack
$ git init
$ touch .gitignore
$ git commit .gitignore
$ git tag origin
    </pre>
    Then apply the patches to the current directory.  For example, if the
    patches are in ~/patches/namestack, apply them with:
    <pre>
$ git am ~/patches/namestack/*
    </pre>
    The kernel module expects the <a href="#kernel">modified kernel source</a>
    is available in a sibling directory named linux-2.6.27.  If it's in a
    different location, you'll have to modify the Makefile.  It contains
    the following line:
    <pre>
KERN_BUILD := ../linux-2.6.27
    </pre>
    Modify it to the location of the kernel you're building against.
    <em>Reminder: the kernel must have the <a href="#kernel">patches</a>
    applied.</em>
    <p>
    Once you've applied the patches that define the name-oriented stack module,
    you can build the module by typing make.  Assuming all goes well, you'll
    end up with a module name namestack.ko.  You can load the module by typing:
    <pre>
$ sudo /sbin/insmod namestack.ko
    </pre>
    If you look at /var/log/messages, you should see a line similar to the
    following:
    <pre>
Aug 28 05:19:31 juan-vubuntu kernel: [ 4615.804707] name-oriented stack module loading
    </pre>
    If you see an error loading the module, you probably aren't running the
    <a href="#kernel">modified kernel</a>.
    <a name="daemon">
    <h2>4.3. Building and running the daemon</h2>
    </a>
    The daemon is also available as, you guessed it, a series of patches.
    Create a directory named namestackd for the daemon:
    <pre>
$ mkdir namestackd
$ cd namestackd
$ git init
$ touch .gitignore
$ git commit .gitignore
$ git tag origin
    </pre>
    And assuming the patches are in ~/patches/namestackd, apply them:
    <pre>
$ git am ~/patches/namestackd/*
    </pre>
    Once you've got a copy of the daemon's source, build it using make, and run
    it.  It doesn't need any special privileges for now, but it won't do
    anything unless the <a href="#kernel">modified kernel</a> is running and
    the <a href="#module">kernel module</a> is loaded.

    <a name="test">
    <h2>4.4. Building and running the test client and server</h2>
    </a>
    The client and server are just a single C file and Makefile each.  The
    <a href="client">source for the client</a> and the <a href="server">source
    for the server</a> is included as part of this distribution.
    <p>
    Each expects the kernel to be available in a sibling directory named
    linux-2.6.27.  If the location is different, modify the Makefile
    accordingly.
    <p>
    Building them is simple:  just type 'make' in each one's source directory.
    I'll describe running the server first, then the client.
    <h3>4.4.1. Running the server</h3>
    In order to run the server, you'll need to pick a name the server listens
    on.  (This is similar to specifying the port to listen on.)  You'll also
    need to provide a port:  one of the limitations I mentioned earlier is that
    the client must know the server's port, even if it knows the server's
    name.
    <p>
    In general, a name is a DNS name.  Special forms of names are supported
    that allow the server to specify that it only wants to listen for
    connections from the local machine, or to specify the IP address on which
    it wants to listen.  Because one of the unimplemented features is domain
    name registration, we'll have to use one of these special forms of name
    for now.
    <p>
    If you want to test connections on a single machine, the domain to use is
    .localhost.  So, for example, to listen to the name server on port 5000
    on the local machine, run:
    <pre>
$ ./namestackserver -p 5000 server.localhost.
    </pre>
    Note the terminating dot:  without it the name-oriented stack module
    assumes the name should be registered in the default domain.
    <p>
    If all goes well, you should see output like the following on the server:
    <pre>
creating a socket with domain = 35, type = 1, protocol = 0
got a socket!
binding to server.localhost.:5000
bind succeeded!
    </pre>
    If you see some error, you're likely not running the
    <a href="#kernel">modified kernel</a>, or the <a href="#module">kernel
    module</a> isn't loaded correctly.  Also, the "domain = " value should
    reflect the definition of AF_NAME in the kernel you're running.  It may
    or may not be 35.
    <p>
    If you want to accept connections from another machine, this is possible
    by specifying the IP address of one of the machine's interfaces using
    the canonical form of the name.  You can either specify an IPv4 address
    or an IPv6 address, although specifying an IPv4 address means the name
    options are not transferred, which isn't very interesting.  It can be
    useful to make sure everything's built and running correctly, however.
    <p>
    If you want to listen on IPv4 address 10.0.0.1, for example, you'd use
    the name 1.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.
    <em>Note: this domain isn't intended to be used forever, we just haven't
        specified the final one yet.</em>
    <p>
    So, listening for the name test on the IP address 10.0.0.1, port 5000
    would be done with the following command:
    <pre>
$ ./namestackserver -p 5000 server.1.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.
    </pre>
    Listening on an IPv6 address is also possible, although the syntax is a
    little inconvenient to type.  If your IPv6 address is
    fc00:abcd:1234:5678:0000:0800:2700:b260, you'd use the canonical domain
    \[xfc00abcd12345678000008002700b260].ip6.arpa.  So listening for the name
    server on this domain, port 5000 would be done with the following command:
    <pre>
$ ./namestackserver -p 5000 server.\\[xfc00abcd12345678000008002700b260].ip6.arpa.
    </pre>
    Note the double-backslash:  this escapes the backslash character in the
    shell.
    <h3>4.4.2. Running the client</h3>
    Running the client is similar.  You'll need to provide the port to connect
    to, and the name to connect to.  For example, if your server is listening
    on port 5000 and the name server.localhost., run the client with:
    <pre>
$ ./namestackclient -p 5000 server.localhost.
    </pre>
    As before, the name needs a terminating dot.
    <p>
    If all goes well, you should see something like the following on the
    server:
    <pre>
connection accepted from \[x00000000000000000000000000000001/128].ip6.arpa.
wrote hello message
got a reply: greetings
    </pre>
    The "connection accepted from" line tells you the name of the client that
    connected.  Here, it's gotten a connection from the IPv6 loopback address,
    ::1.  If you connect with a client on a different machine, you should
    see the canonical form of the address from which they are connecting
    instead.
    <p>
    The client should give similar output, something like:
    <pre>
creating a socket with domain = 35, type = 1, protocol = 0
got a socket!
connecting to server.localhost.:5000:
connect succeeded!
got a message: hello
wrote a reply
    </pre>
    <p>
    The client also allows you to specify a name to use.  For example, if
    you want to connect using the name client.localhost., run the client
    with the command:
    <pre>
$ ./namestackclient -p 5000 -s client.localhost. server.localhost.
    </pre>
    Then, instead of the server reporting a canonical name for the client,
    you should see output like:
    <pre>
connection accepted from client.localhost.
wrote hello message
got a reply: greetings
