    <h2>6. Compiling and running the prototype on the android dev phone</h2>
    The prototype for the android dev phone consists of several pieces:
    <ol>
        <li><a href="#kernel">A modified Linux kernel</a>.
        The modified kernel contains the name-oriented stack component
        directly, rather than being a loadable kernel module.</li>
        <li><a href="#daemon">A userspace daemon</a>.
        This handles tasks like DNS queries on behalf of the kernel module.</li>
        <li>A test <a href="#test">client</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <a name="kernel">
    <h2>Kernel modifications</h2>
    </a>
    This assumes that you already know how to
    <a href="../dream.html">compile and run a modified kernel</a> on your
    development phone, including how to get the Wi-Fi driver working with your
    modified kernel.
    <p>
    I don't describe how to get the prototype running on the emulator, because
    the emulator "machine" doesn't support IPv6.  It's possible to run an
    IPv6-enabled kernel on the emulator, but it'll never receive IPv6 packets
    as a result of the emulator's lack of IPv6 support.  It may be useful to
    develop and test on the emulator, using IPv4 only, using similar steps,
    but how to do so I leave up to you.
    <p>
    First off, you're going to have to apply the patches for version 2.6.25
    of the kernel.  Assuming you're in the top-level kernel source tree for
    the dream phone, /Volumes/android/kernel-msm/msm, and the kernel patches
    are in ~/patches/kernel,
<pre>
$ git am ~/patches/kernel/2.6.25/*
</pre>
    Next apply the common kernel patches:
<pre>
$ git am ~/patches/kernel/common/*
</pre>
    Next apply the patches that allow the namestack directory to be built.
<pre>
$ git am ~/patches/kernel/android/2.6.25/*
</pre>
    Finally, apply the patches that actually comprise the name-oriented stack:
<pre>
$ git am ~/patches/kernel/android/*
</pre>
    Now the kernel source is ready to be built.  Edit the .config file to add
    the line:
<pre>
CONFIG_NAMESTACK=y
</pre>
    and build the kernel with:
<pre>
$ ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi- make
</pre>
    If all is well, you'll get a new kernel in arch/arm/boot/zImage.  Combine
    it with a ramdisk to produce a new boot image like you did before:
<pre>
$ mkbootimg --kernel arch/arm/boot/zImage \
  --ramdisk /path/to/boot.img-ramdisk.gz --cmdline 'no_console_suspend=1 console=null' -o boot-2.6.25-name.img
</pre>
    I gave this boot image a different name than the old one just to keep
    them separate.
    <p>
    You'll also <a href="../dream.html#wlan">need to rebuild and install the
    Wi-Fi driver on the phone</a> in the same way you did before.
    <p>
    Finally, reboot the phone, holding down the camera and power buttons when
    it starts up again to boot it in fastboot mode, and use the fastboot tool
    to boot your new image:
<pre>
$ fastboot boot boot-2.6.25-name.img
</pre>
    If your phone starts and you're able to use the Wi-Fi interface with it,
    your kernel is now ready to run the prototype applications.
    <a name="daemon">
    <h2>Building and running the daemon</h2>
    </a>
    In order to build the daemon, you'll need to have a copy of both the
    android SDK and the android NDK installed.  You'll also need to have
    ant installed.  You can install this on the Mac with:
    <pre>
$ sudo port install apache-ant
    </pre>
    and on Ubuntu with apt-get, or Fedora with yum.
    <p>
    Once both the SDK and NDK are installed, create a directory to store the
    Java portion of the daemon.  Change to the NDK directory, and create
    a subdirectory named apps/namestackd, and apply the patches to create
    the application.  You'll recognize this pattern:
<pre>
$ mkdir apps/namestackd
$ cd apps/namestackd
$ git init
$ touch .gitignore
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit .gitignore
$ git tag origin
$ git am ~/patches/android/namestackd/*
</pre>
    The first patch creates a fairly large directory structure and a lot of
    files, but it's all boilerplate.  You could also have created the same
    files yourself using the android tool that's in the SDK by running:
    <pre>
$ &lt;sdk&gt;/tools/android create project --target 1 \
   --path &lt;ndk&gt;/apps/namestackd/project --activity namestackd \
   --package com.ericsson.namestackd
    </pre>
    Where &lt;sdk&gt; is the location of your android SDK, and &lt;ndk&gt; is
    the locaion of your android NDK.
    <p>
    The second patch adds the Java portion of the implementation, which is
    pretty small.  The bulk of the code is in the C source, which is shared
    with the Linux prototype.  You'll make that next.
    <p>
    Change back to the NDK directory, make the directory for the daemon's C
    source, and apply the patches that comprise the daemon.  You'll need to
    create a subdirectory of the ndk's sources directory named namestackd,
    initialize git in it, and apply the patches.  Here's the familiar pattern
    again:
<pre>
$ mkdir sources/namestackd
$ cd sources/namestackd
$ git init
$ touch .gitignore
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit .gitignore
$ git tag origin
$ git am ~/patches/namestackd/*
</pre>
    Now make the shared library for the daemon:
    <pre>
$ make APP=namestackd
    </pre>
    Then change to the app's project directory, and use ant to build it:
    <pre>
$ cd apps/namestackd/project
$ ant debug
    </pre>
    If everything went well, you should see a couple lines like the following
    at the end of the output:
<pre>
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 3 seconds
</pre>
    Then install the daemon on the phone using:
    <pre>
$ adb install &lt;ndk&gt;/apps/namestackd/project/bin/namestackd-debug.apk
    </pre>

    <a name="test">
    <h2>Building and running the test client</h2>
    </a>
    For the time being, I've only implemented a client for the android phone.
    Thus, in order to test it, you'll want to have a server running on the
    <a href="../linux/index.html">Linux implementation</a> to test against.
    <p>
    Again, change to the NDK directory, and create a directory for the Java
    portion of the client, initialize git in it, and apply the patches that
    create it:
<pre>
$ mkdir apps/NameStackClient
$ cd apps/NameStackClient
$ git init
$ touch .gitignore
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit .gitignore
$ git tag origin
$ git am ~/patches/android/NameStackClient/app/*
</pre>
    Again, the first commit is just boilerplate, which you could have created
    using:
    <pre>
$ &lt;sdk&gt;/tools/android create project --target 1 \
   --path &lt;ndk&gt;/apps/NameStackClient/project \
   --activity NameStackClient --package com.ericsson.namestack
    </pre>
    <p>
    Change back to the NDK directory, and make the directory that contains
    the shared library for the client:
<pre>
$ mkdir sources/NameStackClient
$ cd sources/NameStackClient
$ git init
$ touch .gitignore
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit .gitignore
$ git tag origin
$ git am ~/patches/android/NameStackClient/lib/*
</pre>
    Then change back to the NDK directory, and build the shared library for
    the client:
    <pre>
$ cd ../..
$ make APP=NameStackClient
    </pre>
    Change to the app's project directory, and use ant to build it:
    <pre>
$ cd apps/NameStackClient/project
$ ant debug
    </pre>
    Then install the client on the phone using:
    <pre>
$ adb install &lt;ndk&gt;/apps/NameStackClient/project/bin/NameStackClient-debug.apk
    </pre>
    You should now see a new application on the phone, NameStackClient:
    <br>
    <img src="apps.png">
    <br>
    (It's shown here on the emulator, just so I can show screenshots.)
    <p>
    Clicking on the application should show the following screen:
    <br>
    <img src="client.png">
    <br>
    Setting the source name is optional.  The destination name is one that
    should be resolvable by the phone.  Since the prototype currently doesn't
    do DNS updates, this is a challenge, which you can work around in one of
    two ways:
    <ol>
        <li>Use a canonical name for the server.  This requires you to know
        the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the server, and for the server to
        be started up listening on the canonical address rather than with
        no suffix.
        <p>
        So, for example, if the IPv6 address of the server is
        fe80::a00:27ff:fe00:b260, and you want to start the server up to
        listen to name test on port 5000, start it up as follows:
        <pre>
$ ./namestackserver -p 5000 test.\\[xfe800000000000000a0027fffe00b260].ip6.arpa.
        </pre>
        Then, on the client, use the same name as the destination name on the
        android application:
        <pre>
test.\[xfe800000000000000a0027fffe00b260].ip6.arpa.
        </pre>
        Note you don't need the double backslash on the android client, since
        you're not interacting with a shell.
        <p>
        Similarly, if the IPv4 address of the server is 10.0.1.1, and you want
        it to listen for name test on port 5000, start it up as follows:
        <pre>
$ ./namestackserver -p 5000 test.1.1.0.10.in-addr.arpa.
        </pre>
        Again, on the client, use the same name as the destination name on the
        android application:
        <pre>
test.1.1.0.10.in-addr.arpa.
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Modify <a href="hack.patch">this hack</a> to hardcode the IPv6
        address of the server, and apply it to the daemon.  You'll need to
        modify the hardcoded hack_address to match the address of the server.
        After you apply the patch, you'll need to rebuild the daemon and
        install it on the phone in order to use it.
        </li>
    </ol>
    Also note that the client application is hardcoded to connect to port 5000,
    mainly to keep the UI from being too messy.  Modify it to suit your needs.
    <p>
    Once your server is set up correctly, and you've typed its name into the
    destination name field on the phone, click Connect.  You should see
    messages about creating a socket and sending and receiving a message.
    If instead you see an error about the address family not being supported:

    You're not running <a href="#kernel">the modified kernel</a>.  Otherwise,
    congratulations!  You've successfully built and run the prototype Linux
    and android implementations.
